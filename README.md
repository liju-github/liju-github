# Hello World! 👋 

Just another curious dev who breaks stuff to learn how they work 🔨
(Don't worry, I usually fix them... eventually 😅)

## 🛠️ Playing With
```
Primary: Go (Gin) + MySQL/MongoDB + React (shadcn/ui is my new toy!) 🚀
Architecture: MVC, Clean, Microservices (because why use one when you can use all?)
DevOps: CI/CD, Docker and K8s (still figuring out what all these whales do 🐳)
OS: Linux (sudo dnf install fedora btw... 😅)
```

## 🌱 Currently
- Learning everything that catches my eye
- Building stuff that might or might not work
- Breaking my production environment (oops)
- Trying to understand why my Go routines are not routine 🤔
- Attempting to master Linux without breaking my system (too late!)

## ⚡ Fun fact
I collect new tech like some people collect Pokemon cards - gotta learn 'em all! 

```go
for {
    select {
    case <-learnNewTech:
        fmt.Println("Another technology? Why not!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Still processing the last 10 things I started learning...")
    }
}
```
